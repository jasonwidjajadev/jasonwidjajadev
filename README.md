## Hi there 👋

I’m a penultimate Computer Science student at the University of New South Wales, majoring in Artificial Intelligence, with hands-on experience building backend systems, full-stack web applications, and data-driven ML projects.

I enjoy working close to the system level — designing APIs, reasoning about data models, and turning ambiguous requirements into reliable, well-structured solutions.

Before transitioning into tech, I worked as a designer, which shaped how I approach engineering:
thinking in constraints, iterating deliberately, and building things that are not just correct, but intuitive to use.

Thanks for stopping by — feel free to explore my repos or reach out 😊
